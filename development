Installing new firebase npm packages:
    Because firebase has a symlink to our root directory `node_modules` folder, only add to the modules package.json file, do not
    install from within firebase root directory or you will have to re-install all packages again.
    To add to a package.json without installing, install the `adddeps` npm package globally by running the following command:

    `sudo npm install adddep -g`.

    This will allow you to add the latest versions of dependencies to firebase package.json file without installing them.
    To then install those dependencies, run the following command from the project root directory:

    `npm run firebase:install`

    This will merge all firebase level package.json files into the root package.json and install.
    This ensures we only install our dependencies for all services once.

Module level npm package and script commands:
    The following commands are available to speed up development when working with firebase:

    `npm run firebase:merge`        - Merges all firebase package.json dependencies into the root package.json
    `npm run firebase:install`      - Runs the `firebase:merge` command before running `npm run install`
    `npm run firebase:symlink`      - Adds a `node_modules` symlink to the firebase root, linking to the root node_modules folder.
